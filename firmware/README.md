# ESP32 WebSocket Audio Client

This firmware turns your Seed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3 (or general ESP32 WROOM Dev module) device into a WebSocket audio client, enabling real-time full-duplex audio communication with the server hosted at `../backend`. It's designed to be used in interactive toys or devices to converse with your personal AI characters.

## Firmware burning with PlatformIO

1. Install PlatformIO IDE (Visual Studio Code extension) if you haven't already.

2. Create a new PlatformIO project:

    - Open PlatformIO Home
    - Click "New Project"
    - Name your project (e.g., "FullDuplexWebSocketAudio")
    - Select "Espressif ESP32 Dev Module" as the board
    - Choose "Arduino" as the framework
    - Select a location for your project

3. Replace the contents of `src/main.cpp` with the provided ESP32 WebSocket Audio Client code.

4. Add the required libraries to your `platformio.ini` file:

   - For Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3

       ```ini
       [env:seeed_xiao_esp32s3]
       platform = espressif32
       board = seeed_xiao_esp32s3
       framework = arduino
       monitor_speed = 115200
       lib_deps =
           https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager.git
           gilmaimon/ArduinoWebsockets@^0.5.4
           bblanchon/ArduinoJson@^7.1.0
       ```

   - For a general ESP32 Dev board
       ```ini
       [env:esp32dev]
       platform = espressif32
       board = esp32dev
       framework = arduino
       monitor_speed = 115200
       lib_deps =
           https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager.git
           gilmaimon/ArduinoWebsockets @ ^0.5.3
           bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^7.1.0
       ```

    - For ESP32-S3 Dev Board
        ```ini
        [env:esp32-s3-devkitm-1]
        platform = espressif32
        board = esp32-s3-devkitm-1
        framework = arduino
        monitor_speed = 115200
        lib_deps =
            https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager.git
            gilmaimon/ArduinoWebsockets @ ^0.5.3
            bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^7.1.0
        ```

5. Update the WebSocket server details in the code:

    - Find the following lines in the code and update them with your information:
        ```cpp
        const char *websocket_server_host = "<your-server-host>"; // this is your WiFi I.P. Address
        const uint16_t websocket_server_port = 8000;
        const char *websocket_server_path = "/starmoon";
        const char *auth_token = "<your-auth-token-here>"; // generate auth-token in your starmoon web app in Settings
        ```

6. Build the project:

    - Click the "PlatformIO: Build" button in the PlatformIO toolbar or run the build task.

7. Upload the firmware:

    - Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
    - Click the "PlatformIO: Upload" button or run the upload task.

8. Monitor the device:

    - Open the Serial Monitor to view debug output and device status.
    - You can do this by clicking the "PlatformIO: Serial Monitor" button or running the monitor task.

9. Connect to WiFi using the WiFi Captive portal
    - It is straightforward to connect to your local Wifi network with an SSID (WiFi name) and Password.
    - Once the device is on, it acts as an Access Point to connect to a known WiFi network.
    - Find the device name "Starmoon device" in your list of local wifi networks.
    - Press "Configure Wifi" and type in your SSID and PW for your Wifi and connect.
    - The Seeed Stuido XIAO ESP32S3 should then automatically connect to your Wifi and save your Wifi details.

## Usage

1. Power on the ESP32 device.
2. The device will automatically connect to the WiFi network as set on the Captive portal.
3. Press the button to initiate a full-duplex WebSocket connection to the server.
4. The LED indicates the current status:

    - Off: Not connected
    - Solid On: Connected and listening on microphone
    - Pulsing: Streaming audio output (receiving from server)

5. Speak into the microphone to send audio to the server.
6. The device will play audio received from the server through the speaker.

<!-- ## Features -->

<!-- -   Real-time audio streaming using WebSocket
-   Full-duplex I2S audio input (microphone) and I2S audio output (speaker)
-   WiFi connectivity
-   LED status indicator -->
<!-- -   Button interrupt for connection management -->

<!-- ## Hardware Requirements

-   ESP32 development board
-   INMP441 MEMS microphone (I2S input)
-   MAX98357A amplifier (I2S output)
-   LED (for status indication)
-   Push button (for connection control)
-   USB Type-C or Micro USB power cable -->


## Functions

-   `micTask`: Handles audio input from the microphone
-   `buttonTask`: Manages button presses for connection control
-   `ledControlTask`: Controls the LED status indicator
-   `handleTextMessage`: Processes text messages from the server
-   `handleBinaryAudio`: Processes binary audio data from the server

## Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the code:

<!-- -   Audio sample rate (`SAMPLE_RATE`) -->
-   Buffer sizes (`bufferCnt`, `bufferLen`)
<!-- -   LED brightness levels (`MIN_BRIGHTNESS`, `MAX_BRIGHTNESS`) -->
-   Debounce time for the button (`DEBOUNCE_TIME`)

## Troubleshooting

-   If you experience connection issues, check your WiFi credentials and server details.
-   Ensure all required libraries are installed and up to date.
-   Verify that the pin configuration matches your hardware setup.
